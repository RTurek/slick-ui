# Slick
"Slick!" is a component library developed by Ryan Turek, based on Material-UI

# Instructions for LOCAL development
- Install `slick-ui` locally
  - Clone copy of repo from GitHub
    - [https://github.com/rturek/slick-ui](https://github.com/rturek/slick-ui)
    - `gh repo clone rturek/slick-ui`
  - Run `npm run`
    - This installs node_modules, builds the project, and runs linter and tests
