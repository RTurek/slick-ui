#### Avatar
---
This variant on Material UI's Avatar gives you some control over color, size, and lets you add a fallback icon.

#### Notes
---
- If there is an image URL, we show the image.
- If there is an error with the image, we show the initials.
- If there are no initials (no first name OR no last name) we show the default svg (the Anonymous component).
